# Capstone-project-time-series-forecasting
The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that accurately forecasts the weekly sales for each outlet of the retail store chain. By utilizing the available time-related data, the model will enable the company to proactively manage inventory levels and ensure a more efficient supply chain.
In this capstone project, Walmart's sales prediction is achieved using time series forecasting techniques. The process involves essential steps such as stationarity checks, a comparison between ARIMA and SARIMAX models, and the integration of external factors into the ARIMA model for enhanced predictions. After rigorous experimentation, a custom function is developed, enabling sales forecasting based on a store ID. In cases of non-stationary data, the function incorporates differencing to ensure stationarity. The comprehensive project report, encompassing these methodologies, is provided as an attachment.
